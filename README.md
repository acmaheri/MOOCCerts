The repository stores my academic certificates which are acquired from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 
Thus far the certificates of the following courses with their respective learning platform are included:-

## [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)
### Completed Courses
- [Writing Scientific Papers and Making Presentations in English](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:TsinghuaX+60250101+1T2017/course/)
- [Using Python for Research](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+3T2016/course/)

- [Software Construction: Object Oriented Design](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+SoftConst2x+3T2017/course/)


## [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/)
### Completed Courses
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
- [Deep Learning](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
### On-progress
Unlike [Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Edx](https://www.edx.org/), some of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) courses seems to have expensive taste. If I would have enough time, I would be taking the following courses:-
 
 - [Become A Robotics Software Engineer](https://eu.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209) (€1798). 
 - [Natural Language Processing](https://eu.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892) (€599) 
 
The above-mentioned courses are more practical and have great contents as well, but their price tag act as a disqualifying criterion for some including myself.

However, it may sound weird that I am complaining about the price, in Germany, we pay almost nothing for knowledge itself but we pay more taxes afterward when we starting using the knowledge to earn money, which makes more sense. 

In the meantime, in case you happen to have information regarding an individual or a company or a funding organization or a foundation that is offering a sponsorship with affordable conditions (I mean with little to no strings attached) for taking up an on-line course or specialization, please contact [me](https://www.facebook.com/SCHWARZSCHILD).
